# Bookish Blaze
**Bookish Blaze**

*Bookish Blaze* is a virtual book club that enables users worldwide to connect and share their opinions on books. The mechanics are based on the administrator uploading a book every week, which becomes the selected book for the weekly reading. Once read, users can leave their opinions on it. Additionally, users will have a list of books read in previous weeks and can read others' opinions as well as write their own.
